# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

## Pre-processing Dataset and Training the Deep Learning Model for Driver Awareness Monitoring 

## Steps for Pre-processing
1. Converting Video to Fames
2. Rotating the Frames 
3. Detect Faces in the Frames and Crop the Faces Out
4. Move Frames to Respective Class Folder 
5. Split the Dataset Into Training Set, Validation Set and Test Set
6. Remove Frames Without A Type

## Deep Learning Model 
Transfer Learning using MobileNetV2
